# get-ready-go

# Project Overview
This is an app I made for my 6 year old daughter after many rough mornings failing to get out of the house on time.  It is a simple app that lists all of her "chores" or "responsibilities" in the morning.  As she completes them, the buttons disable.  After the all the items are complete, she gets a randomly generated point value towards a grand prize and a silly cat gif. 

The project utilizes firebase, giphy api, jquery, bootstrap and javascript.
